# `game-template`

This is a template for [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate). I'm using it as I learn about game development in Rust, so right now, it is *very light* on detail. Eventually, I'll flush it out a bit more.

It follows the design from [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate) and borrows code for the Github Workflows from [Github Actions for Rust binaries](https://github.com/paskausks/rust-bin-github-workflows) and [Release Action](https://github.com/ncipollo/release-action), with only a few minor modifications.
